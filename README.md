# WH_Asgmt_W05

This is a MySQL basic practice on creating database and tables, as well as "add", "select"," update", "inner join", and Aggregate Functions,etc.

In this practice, I createad a database named "website", along with 2 tables "member" and "message". Then I used "select" together with the "inner join" to get some specific results to meet the requirements from the assigment. 

The complete command lines of the whole practice are presented on the first 3 screenshots, which are also exported as the file data.sql. The driven results are visualized on the following screenshots.
